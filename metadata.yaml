description: '"How dreadfully old I am getting! Sixteen!" So begins Stepping Heavenward
  by Elizabeth Prentiss, the journal-like account of a nineteenth century girl who
  learns, on the path to womanhood, that true happiness can be found in giving oneself
  for others. "This book is a treasure of both godly and womanly wisdom told with
  disarming candor and humility, yet revealing a deep heart''s desire to know God,"
  says noted Christian speaker Elisabeth Elliot. "I do not hesitate to recommend it
  to men, who need to understand the wives they live with, and to any woman who wants
  to walk with God."'
